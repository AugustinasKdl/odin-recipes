    <p>This tuna noodle casserole is the best with a classic creamy taste from my childhood. </p>
    <p>The sauce is rich and creamy but not overwhelmingly heavy.</p>
    <p>The crunch from the topping and fresh bite from the parsley create the perfect balance.</p>
    <p><strong>Let's not forget that this is a great budget-friendly meal to feed a crowd!</strong></p>
