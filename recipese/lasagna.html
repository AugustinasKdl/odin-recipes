        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p> 
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,</p>
            <p>basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.</p> 
            <p>Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,</p>
            <p>remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p> 
            <p>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. </p>
            <p>Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. </p>
            <p>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p> 
            <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
